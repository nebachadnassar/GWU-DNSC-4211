Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['labels'].value_counts()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":272},"id":"Ds-7Kh1K0vdk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744149778247,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Ned Hulseman","userId":"09257865270106672986"}},"outputId":"edbe7b37-71c2-44fc-b952-44093cc6b65d"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["labels\n","sport            511\n","business         510\n","politics         417\n","tech             401\n","entertainment    386\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>labels</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>sport</th>\n","      <td>511</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>business</th>\n","      <td>510</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>politics</th>\n","      <td>417</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>tech</th>\n","      <td>401</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>entertainment</th>\n","      <td>386</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Text Processing"],"metadata":{"id":"WgZCgAze1XEn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#-- Text to upper case\n","df['Documents_Cased'] = df['data'].str.upper()\n","\n","#-- Remove Punctuation\n","import string\n","print(string.punctuation)\n","df['Documents_rmPunct'] = df['Documents_Cased'].str.replace('[{}]'.format(string.punctuation), '', regex=True)\n","\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":223},"id":"cU-odA1H0x3Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744149805470,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":701,"user":{"displayName":"Ned Hulseman","userId":"09257865270106672986"}},"outputId":"656399aa-d65b-4259-9577-28c0ceaba48a"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                data         labels  \\\n","0  Musicians to tackle US red tape  Musicians gro...  entertainment   \n","1  U2s desire to be number one  U2, who have won ...  entertainment   \n","2  Rocker Doherty in on-stage fight  Rock singer ...  entertainment   \n","3  Snicket tops US box office chart  The film ada...  entertainment   \n","4  Oceans Twelve raids box office  Oceans Twelve,...  entertainment   \n","\n","                                     Documents_Cased  \\\n","0  MUSICIANS TO TACKLE US RED TAPE  MUSICIANS GRO...   \n","1  U2S DESIRE TO BE NUMBER ONE  U2, WHO HAVE WON ...   \n","2  ROCKER DOHERTY IN ON-STAGE FIGHT  ROCK SINGER ...   \n","3  SNICKET TOPS US BOX OFFICE CHART  THE FILM ADA...   \n","4  OCEANS TWELVE RAIDS BOX OFFICE  OCEANS TWELVE,...   \n","\n","                                   Documents_rmPunct  \n","0  MUSICIANS TO TACKLE US RED TAPE  MUSICIANS GRO...  \n","1  U2S DESIRE TO BE NUMBER ONE  U2 WHO HAVE WON T...  \n","2  ROCKER DOHERTY IN ONSTAGE FIGHT  ROCK SINGER P...  \n","3  SNICKET TOPS US BOX OFFICE CHART  THE FILM ADA...  \n","4  OCEANS TWELVE RAIDS BOX OFFICE  OCEANS TWELVE ...

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work.

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Documents_Cased\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2125,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MEDIA SEEK JACKSON JUROR NOTES  REPORTERS COVERING SINGER MICHAEL JACKSONS TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ASKED TO SEE QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY POTENTIAL JURORS.

IT IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR IDEA THAT MAKES USE OF RSS (REALLY SIMPLE SYNDICATION) AND AUDIO TECHNOLOGY TO LET PEOPLE EASILY MAKE THEIR OWN RADIO SHOWS, AND DISTRIBUTE THEM AUTOMATICALLY ONTO PORTABLE DEVICES.  MANY ARE DONE BY THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE TEXT-BASED BLOGS, SO THEY ARE ALMOST LIKE AUDIO BLOGS. THREE NEW CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST THIS YEAR, INCLUDING BEST FOOD, BEST ENTERTAINMENT, AND BEST WRITING OF A WEBLOG. ONE OF THE CATEGORIES THAT WAS SCRAPPED THOUGH WAS BEST MUSIC BLOG. THE WINNERS OF THE FIFTH ANNUAL BLOGGIES ARE CHOSEN BY THE PUBLIC. PUBLIC VOTING CLOSES ON 3 FEBRUARY AND THE WINNERS WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOMETIME BETWEEN 13 AND 15 MARCH. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

\"IRAQ ADVICE CLAIM SPARKS NEW ROW  THE TORIES SAY MINISTERS MUST RESPOND IN PARLIAMENT TO CLAIMS THAT THE LEGAL ADVICE USED TO JUSTIFY THE IRAQ WAR WAS DRAWN UP AT NUMBER 10  DOWNING STREET HAS DENIED THE CLAIMS MADE IN A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LORD GOLDSMITHS ADVICE LORD GOLDSMITH ALSO DENIED THEM SAYING HE WAS NOT LEANED ON IN ANY WAY BUT THE CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WANT THE PUBLICATION OF THE FULL LEGAL ADVICE GIVEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO PUBLISH LORD GOLDSMITHS ADVICE ON THE LEGALITY OF THE WAR  SAYING SUCH PAPERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KEPT CONFIDENTIAL  BUT A SHORT STATEMENT ABOUT LORD GOLDSMITHS POSITION WAS PRESENTED IN A WRITTEN PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER ON 17 MARCH 2003  JUST BEFORE A CRUCIAL COMMONS VOTE ON THE MILITARY ACTION IT SAID IT WAS PLAIN IRAQ CONTINUED TO BE IN MATERIAL BREACH OF UN RESOLUTION 1441 IN HIS NEW BOOK LAWLESS WORLD PHILIPPE SANDS A QC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW PROFESSOR SUGGESTS THE PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER WAS WRITTEN IN DOWNING STREET ACCORDING TO MR SANDS LORD GOLDSMITH HAD WARNED TONY BLAIR IN A DOCUMENT ON 7 MARCH 2003 THAT THE USE OF FORCE AGAINST IRAQ COULD BE ILLEGAL AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER TO SEEK A SECOND UN RESOLUTION SANCTIONING MILITARY ACTION  MR SANDS TOLD NEWSNIGHT THE GOVERNMENT HAD PREPARED A LEGAL TEAM TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND ITS CASE IN CASE LEGAL ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THE UK OVER THE WAR ON 10 MARCH MILITARY CHIEFS REPORTEDLY ASKED FOR AN UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE WAR TO MAKE SURE TROOPS COULD BE DEFENDED IN A COURT OF LAW THE BOOK BEING SERIALISED IN THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER SAYS ON 13 MARCH LORD GOLDSMITH MET THEN HOME OFFICE MINISTER LORD FALCONER AND DOWNING STREET ADVISER BARONESS MORGAN AFTER THAT DOWNING STREET PROCEEDED TO SET OUT HIS LORD GOLDSMITHS VIEW IN A PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER WHICH WAS THEN PUBLISHED ON 17 MARCH SAID MR SANDS  TORY LEADER MICHAEL HOWARD REITERATED CALLS FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE FULL LEGAL ADVICE GIVEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WARNING THIS ISSUE WILL NOT GO AWAY THESE REVELATIONS THROW AN INTENSIVE SPOTLIGHT ON TO THE CAVALIER WAY IN WHICH THIS GOVERNMENT OPERATES  EVEN ON AN ISSUE AS IMPORTANT AS PEACE AND WAR THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ACT TO RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND TRUST LIBERAL DEMOCRAT FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN MENZIES CAMPBELL REPEATED HIS PARTYS CALLS FOR LORD GOLDSMITHS FIRST PIECE OF LEGAL ADVICE TO BE MADE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS JUSTIFIES NONPUBLICATION OF THE WHOLE OF THE ADVICE CAN ONLY BE SERVED NOW BY THE FULLEST DISCLOSURE  IN A STATEMENT TO NEWSNIGHT LORD GOLDSMITH SAID IN MY PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER ON MARCH 17 2003 I EXPLAINED MY GENUINELY HELD INDEPENDENT VIEW THAT MILITARY ACTION WAS LAWFUL UNDER THE EXISTING SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT A VIEW THAT I EXPRESSED AS A RESULT OF BEING LEANED ON IN ANY WAY NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY MADE CLEAR WAS IT WRITTEN BY OR AT NUMBER 10 THE PRIME MINISTERS OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REJECTED THE CLAIMS SAYING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE IT CLEAR THE WORDS AND THE JUDGEMENT WERE HIS BUT EXFOREIGN SECRETARY ROBIN COOK SAYS ALL THE ADVICE SHOULD NOW BE PUBLISHED HE SAID THE CLAIMS SUGGESTED PARLIAMENT HAD ONLY RECEIVED A PR233CIS OF LORD GOLDSMITHS SECOND OPINION  AND THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY DRAFTED IN NO 10 THIS WOULD BE WRONG EVEN IF LORD GOLDSMITH HAD SIGNED THE STATEMENT MR COOK SAID BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERALS ADVICE SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT LEGAL OPINION NOT SUBJECT TO POLITICAL NEGOTIATION OF THIS KIND \",\n          \"CONFUSION OVER HIGHDEFINITION TV  NOW THAT A CRITICAL MASS OF PEOPLE HAVE EMBRACED DIGITAL TV DVDS AND DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS THE NEXT REVOLUTION FOR TV IS BEING PREPARED FOR OUR SETS  IN MOST CORNERS OF TV AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES HIGHDEFINITION HDTV IS BEING HERALDED AS THE BIGGEST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE TELEVISION SINCE COLOUR HD ESSENTIALLY MAKES TV PICTURE QUALITY AT LEAST FOUR TIMES BETTER THAN NOW BUT THERE IS REAL CONCERN THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION ABOUT HD ON THE HIGH STREET THOUSANDS OF FLAT PANEL SCREENS  LCDS LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS PLASMA SCREENS AND DLP REARPROJECTION TV SETS  HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLD AS HD BUT ARE IN FACT NOT ABLE TO DISPLAY HD  THE UK IS THE LARGEST DISPLAY MARKET IN EUROPE ACCORDING TO JOHN BINKS DIRECTOR OF GFK WHICH MONITORS GLOBAL CONSUMER MARKETS  BUT HE ADDED OF ALL THE FLAT PANEL SCREENS SOLD JUST 13 IN THE UK ARE CAPABLE OF GETTING HIGHDEFINITION THERE ARE 74 DIFFERENT DEVICES THAT ARE BEING SOLD AS HD BUT ARE NOT HDREADY ACCORDING TO ALEXANDER OUDENDIJK SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING FOR SATELLITE GIANT ASTRA THEY MAY BE FANTASTIC QUALITY TVS BUT MANY DO NOT HAVE ADAPTORS IN THEM  CALLED DVI OR HDMI HIGHDEFINITION MULTIMEDIA INTERFACE CONNECTORS  WHICH LET THE SET HANDLE THE HIGHER RESOLUTION DIGITAL IMAGES PART OF THIS IS DOWN TO LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND TRAINING ON THE HIGH STREET SAY INDUSTRY EXPERTS WHO GATHERED AT BAFTA IN LONDON FOR THE 2ND EUROPEAN HDTV SUMMIT LAST WEEK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CONSUMER CONFUSION THERE IS A MASSIVE EDUCATION PROCESS TO GO THROUGH SAID MR BINKS THE INDUSTRY ALREADY RECOGNISED THAT IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION ABOUT IT ACROSS TO THOSE OF US WHO WILL BE WATCHING IT EVENTUALLY THAT WILL BE EVERYONE THE BBC IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING PLANS TO PRODUCE ALL ITS TV OUTPUT TO MEET HDTV STANDARDS BY 2010  PREPARATIONS FOR THE ANALOGUE SWITCHOFF ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY IN SOME AREAS AND PROGRAMMES ARE BEING FILMED WITH HD CAMERAS BSKYB PLANS TO SHIP ITS FIRST GENERATION SETTOP BOXES TO RECEIVE HDTV BROADCASTS IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS LIKE ITS SKY BOXES THEY WILL ALSO BE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS PVRS THE COMPANY WILL START BROADCASTS OF HDTV PROGRAMMES OFFERING THEM AS PREMIUM CHANNEL PACKAGES CONCENTRATING TO START WITH ON SPORTS BIG EVENTS AND FILMS IN EARLY 2006 BUT THE SETTOP BOX WHICH RECEIVES HDTV BROADCASTS HAS TO PLUG INTO A DISPLAY  TV SET  THAT CAN SHOW THE IMAGES AT THE MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTION THAT HD DEMANDS IF HDTV IS TO BE REAL BY 2010 20 OF HOMES IN THE UK WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF TV SET OR DISPLAY THAT CAN SHOW HD IN ITS FULL GLORY  BUT IT IS ALL GETTING RATHER CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY JUST TAKEN TO BEING DIGITAL AS A RESULT ALL THE KEY PLAYERS THOSE WHO MAKE FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS AS WELL AS THE SATELLITE COMPANIES AND BROADCASTERS FORMED A HD FORUM IN 2004 TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER PART OF THE FORUM HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH ISSUES LIKE INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND CONTENT PROTECTION BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH HOW TO HELP THE PAYING PUBLIC KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR  FROM NEXT MONTH ALL DEVICES THAT HAVE THE RIGHT CONNECTORS AND RESOLUTION REQUIRED WILL CARRY A HDREADY STICKER THIS ALSO MEANS THEY ARE EQUIPPED TO COPE WITH BOTH ANALOGUE AND HDTV SIGNALS AND SO COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM SPECIFICATION SET OUT BY THE INDUSTRY THE LOGO IS ABSOLUTELY THE WAY FORWARD SAID DAVID MERCER ANALYSTS WITH STRATEGY ANALYTICS BUT IT IS STILL NOT APPEARING ON MANY RETAIL PRODUCTS THE INDUSTRY IS UPBEAT THAT THE STICKER WILL HELP BUT IT IS ONLY A START WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WITH THE POSITION WE ARE IN TODAY WITH MANUFACTURERS SAID MR OUDENDIJK THERE MAY WELL BE A NUMBER OF DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE EUROPEAN BROADCAST UNION EBU IS TESTING DIFFERENT FLAVOURS OF HD FORMATS TO PREPARE FOR EVEN BETTER HDTV FURTHER DOWN THE LINE IT IS SIMILARLY CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION ON HDTV FORMATS AS WELL AS WHICH DEVICES WILL SUPPORT THE FORMATS WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS BUYING EXPENSIVE DISPLAYS NEED TO ENSURE THEIR INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE SAID PHIL LAVEN TECHNICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE EBU THE TV DISPLAY MANUFACTURERS WANT US TO WATCH HD ON SCREENS THAT ARE AT LEAST 42IN 106CM TO GET THE TRUE IMPACT OF HD THEY SAY ALTHOUGH SMALLER DISPLAYS SUFFICE WHAT MAY CONVINCE PEOPLE TO SPEND MONEY ON HDREADY DEVICES IS THE FALLING PRICES WHICH CONTINUE TO TUMBLE ACROSS EUROPE THE PRICES ARE DROPPING AN AVERAGE OF 20 EVERY YEAR ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS LCD PRICES DROPPED BY 43 IN EUROPE AS A WHOLE LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO MR

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Documents_Cased\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2125,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MEDIA SEEK JACKSON JUROR NOTES  REPORTERS COVERING SINGER MICHAEL JACKSONS TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ASKED TO SEE QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY POTENTIAL JURORS.

\"IRAQ ADVICE CLAIM SPARKS NEW ROW  THE TORIES SAY MINISTERS MUST RESPOND IN PARLIAMENT TO CLAIMS THAT THE LEGAL ADVICE USED TO JUSTIFY THE IRAQ WAR WAS DRAWN UP AT NUMBER 10  DOWNING STREET HAS DENIED THE CLAIMS MADE IN A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LORD GOLDSMITHS ADVICE LORD GOLDSMITH ALSO DENIED THEM SAYING HE WAS NOT LEANED ON IN ANY WAY BUT THE CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WANT THE PUBLICATION OF THE FULL LEGAL ADVICE GIVEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL  THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO PUBLISH LORD GOLDSMITHS ADVICE ON THE LEGALITY OF THE WAR  SAYING SUCH PAPERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN KEPT CONFIDENTIAL  BUT A SHORT STATEMENT ABOUT LORD GOLDSMITHS POSITION WAS PRESENTED IN A WRITTEN PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER ON 17 MARCH 2003  JUST BEFORE A CRUCIAL COMMONS VOTE ON THE MILITARY ACTION IT SAID IT WAS PLAIN IRAQ CONTINUED TO BE IN MATERIAL BREACH OF UN RESOLUTION 1441 IN HIS NEW BOOK LAWLESS WORLD PHILIPPE SANDS A QC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW PROFESSOR SUGGESTS THE PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER WAS WRITTEN IN DOWNING STREET ACCORDING TO MR SANDS LORD GOLDSMITH HAD WARNED TONY BLAIR IN A DOCUMENT ON 7 MARCH 2003 THAT THE USE OF FORCE AGAINST IRAQ COULD BE ILLEGAL AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER TO SEEK A SECOND UN RESOLUTION SANCTIONING MILITARY ACTION  MR SANDS TOLD NEWSNIGHT THE GOVERNMENT HAD PREPARED A LEGAL TEAM TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND ITS CASE IN CASE LEGAL ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THE UK OVER THE WAR ON 10 MARCH MILITARY CHIEFS REPORTEDLY ASKED FOR AN UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF THE WAR TO MAKE SURE TROOPS COULD BE DEFENDED IN A COURT OF LAW THE BOOK BEING SERIALISED IN THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER SAYS ON 13 MARCH LORD GOLDSMITH MET THEN HOME OFFICE MINISTER LORD FALCONER AND DOWNING STREET ADVISER BARONESS MORGAN AFTER THAT

PARTYS CALLS FOR LORD GOLDSMITHS FIRST PIECE OF LEGAL ADVICE TO BE MADE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHICH THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS JUSTIFIES NONPUBLICATION OF THE WHOLE OF THE ADVICE CAN ONLY BE SERVED NOW BY THE FULLEST DISCLOSURE  IN A STATEMENT TO NEWSNIGHT LORD GOLDSMITH SAID IN MY PARLIAMENTARY ANSWER ON MARCH 17 2003 I EXPLAINED MY GENUINELY HELD INDEPENDENT VIEW THAT MILITARY ACTION WAS LAWFUL UNDER THE EXISTING SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT A VIEW THAT I EXPRESSED AS A RESULT OF BEING LEANED ON IN ANY WAY NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY MADE CLEAR WAS IT WRITTEN BY OR AT NUMBER 10 THE PRIME MINISTERS OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REJECTED THE CLAIMS SAYING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MADE IT CLEAR THE WORDS AND THE JUDGEMENT WERE HIS BUT EXFOREIGN SECRETARY ROBIN COOK SAYS ALL THE ADVICE SHOULD NOW BE PUBLISHED HE SAID THE CLAIMS SUGGESTED PARLIAMENT HAD ONLY RECEIVED A PR233CIS OF LORD GOLDSMITHS SECOND OPINION  AND THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY DRAFTED IN NO 10 THIS WOULD BE WRONG EVEN IF LORD GOLDSMITH HAD SIGNED THE STATEMENT MR COOK SAID BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERALS ADVICE SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT LEGAL OPINION NOT SUBJECT TO POLITICAL NEGOTIATION OF THIS KIND \",\n          \"CONFUSION OVER HIGHDEFINITION TV  NOW THAT A CRITICAL MASS OF PEOPLE HAVE EMBRACED DIGITAL TV DVDS AND DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS THE NEXT REVOLUTION FOR TV IS BEING PREPARED FOR OUR SETS  IN MOST CORNERS OF TV AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES HIGHDEFINITION HDTV IS BEING HERALDED AS THE BIGGEST THING TO HAPPEN TO THE TELEVISION SINCE COLOUR HD ESSENTIALLY MAKES TV PICTURE QUALITY AT LEAST FOUR TIMES BETTER THAN NOW BUT THERE IS REAL CONCERN THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION ABOUT HD ON THE HIGH STREET THOUSANDS OF FLAT PANEL SCREENS  LCDS LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS PLASMA SCREENS AND DLP REARPROJECTION TV SETS  HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLD AS HD BUT ARE IN FACT NOT ABLE TO DISPLAY HD  THE UK IS THE LARGEST DISPLAY MARKET IN EUROPE ACCORDING TO JOHN BINKS DIRECTOR OF GFK WHICH MONITORS GLOBAL CONSUMER MARKETS  BUT HE ADDED OF ALL THE FLAT PANEL SCREENS SOLD JUST 13 IN THE UK ARE CAPABLE OF GETTING HIGHDEFINITION THERE ARE 74 DIFFERENT DEVICES THAT ARE BEING SOLD AS HD BUT ARE NOT HDREADY ACCORDING TO ALEXANDER OUDENDIJK SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING FOR SATELLITE GIANT ASTRA THEY MAY BE FANTASTIC QUALITY TVS BUT MANY DO NOT HAVE ADAPTORS IN THEM  CALLED DVI OR HDMI HIGHDEFINITION MULTIMEDIA INTERFACE CONNECTORS  WHICH LET THE SET HANDLE THE HIGHER RESOLUTION DIGITAL IMAGES PART OF THIS IS DOWN TO LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AND TRAINING ON THE HIGH STREET SAY INDUSTRY EXPERTS WHO GATHERED AT BAFTA IN LONDON FOR THE 2ND EUROPEAN HDTV SUMMIT LAST WEEK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT CONSUMER CONFUSION THERE IS A MASSIVE EDUCATION PROCESS TO GO THROUGH SAID MR BINKS THE INDUSTRY ALREADY RECOGNISED THAT IT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION ABOUT IT ACROSS TO THOSE OF US WHO WILL BE WATCHING IT EVENTUALLY THAT WILL BE EVERYONE THE BBC IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING PLANS TO PRODUCE ALL ITS TV OUTPUT TO MEET HDTV STANDARDS BY 2010  PREPARATIONS FOR THE ANALOGUE SWITCHOFF ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY IN SOME AREAS AND PROGRAMMES ARE BEING FILMED WITH HD CAMERAS BSKYB PLANS TO SHIP ITS FIRST GENERATION SETTOP BOXES TO RECEIVE HDTV BROADCASTS IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS LIKE ITS SKY BOXES THEY WILL ALSO BE PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS PVRS THE COMPANY WILL START BROADCASTS OF HDTV PROGRAMMES OFFERING THEM AS PREMIUM CHANNEL PACKAGES CONCENTRATING TO START WITH ON SPORTS BIG EVENTS AND FILMS IN EARLY 2006 BUT THE SETTOP BOX WHICH RECEIVES HDTV BROADCASTS HAS TO PLUG INTO A DISPLAY  TV SET  THAT CAN SHOW THE IMAGES AT THE MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTION THAT HD DEMANDS IF HDTV IS TO BE REAL BY 2010 20 OF HOMES IN THE UK WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF TV SET OR DISPLAY THAT CAN SHOW HD IN ITS FULL GLORY  BUT IT IS ALL GETTING RATHER CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY JUST TAKEN TO BEING DIGITAL AS A RESULT ALL THE KEY PLAYERS THOSE WHO MAKE FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS AS WELL AS THE SATELLITE COMPANIES AND BROADCASTERS FORMED A HD FORUM IN 2004 TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER PART OF THE FORUM HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH ISSUES LIKE INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND CONTENT PROTECTION BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH HOW TO HELP THE PAYING PUBLIC KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR  FROM NEXT MONTH ALL DEVICES THAT HAVE THE RIGHT CONNECTORS AND RESOLUTION REQUIRED WILL CARRY A HDREADY STICKER THIS ALSO MEANS THEY ARE EQUIPPED TO COPE WITH BOTH ANALOGUE AND HDTV SIGNALS AND SO COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM SPECIFICATION SET OUT BY THE INDUSTRY THE LOGO IS ABSOLUTELY THE WAY FORWARD SAID DAVID MERCER ANALYSTS WITH STRATEGY ANALYTICS BUT IT IS STILL NOT APPEARING ON MANY RETAIL PRODUCTS THE INDUSTRY IS UPBEAT THAT THE STICKER WILL HELP BUT IT IS ONLY A START WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WITH THE POSITION WE ARE IN TODAY WITH MANUFACTURERS SAID MR OUDENDIJK THERE MAY WELL BE A NUMBER OF DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE EUROPEAN BROADCAST UNION EBU IS TESTING DIFFERENT FLAVOURS OF HD FORMATS TO PREPARE FOR EVEN BETTER HDTV FURTHER DOWN THE LINE IT IS SIMILARLY CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION ON HDTV FORMATS AS WELL AS WHICH DEVICES WILL SUPPORT THE FORMATS WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS BUYING EXPENSIVE DISPLAYS NEED TO ENSURE THEIR INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE SAID PHIL LAVEN TECHNICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE EBU THE TV DISPLAY MANUFACTURERS WANT US TO WATCH HD ON SCREENS THAT ARE AT LEAST 42IN 106CM TO GET THE TRUE IMPACT OF HD THEY SAY ALTHOUGH SMALLER DISPLAYS SUFFICE WHAT MAY CONVINCE PEOPLE TO SPEND MONEY ON HDREADY DEVICES IS THE FALLING PRICES WHICH CONTINUE TO TUMBLE ACROSS EUROPE THE PRICES ARE DROPPING AN AVERAGE OF 20 EVERY YEAR ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS LCD PRICES DROPPED BY 43 IN EUROPE AS A WHOLE LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO MR

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Documents_Cased\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2125,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MEDIA SEEK JACKSON JUROR NOTES  REPORTERS COVERING SINGER MICHAEL JACKSONS TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ASKED TO SEE QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY POTENTIAL JURORS.

BROADCASTS OF HDTV PROGRAMMES OFFERING THEM AS PREMIUM CHANNEL PACKAGES CONCENTRATING TO START WITH ON SPORTS BIG EVENTS AND FILMS IN EARLY 2006 BUT THE SETTOP BOX WHICH RECEIVES HDTV BROADCASTS HAS TO PLUG INTO A DISPLAY  TV SET  THAT CAN SHOW THE IMAGES AT THE MUCH HIGHER RESOLUTION THAT HD DEMANDS IF HDTV IS TO BE REAL BY 2010 20 OF HOMES IN THE UK WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF TV SET OR DISPLAY THAT CAN SHOW HD IN ITS FULL GLORY  BUT IT IS ALL GETTING RATHER CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY JUST TAKEN TO BEING DIGITAL AS A RESULT ALL THE KEY PLAYERS THOSE WHO MAKE FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS AS WELL AS THE SATELLITE COMPANIES AND BROADCASTERS FORMED A HD FORUM IN 2004 TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER PART OF THE FORUM HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH ISSUES LIKE INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND CONTENT PROTECTION BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH HOW TO HELP THE PAYING PUBLIC KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE PAYING FOR  FROM NEXT MONTH ALL DEVICES THAT HAVE THE RIGHT CONNECTORS AND RESOLUTION REQUIRED WILL CARRY A HDREADY STICKER THIS ALSO MEANS THEY ARE EQUIPPED TO COPE WITH BOTH ANALOGUE AND HDTV SIGNALS AND SO COMPLY WITH THE MINIMUM SPECIFICATION SET OUT BY THE INDUSTRY THE LOGO IS ABSOLUTELY THE WAY FORWARD SAID DAVID MERCER ANALYSTS WITH STRATEGY ANALYTICS BUT IT IS STILL NOT APPEARING ON MANY RETAIL PRODUCTS THE INDUSTRY IS UPBEAT THAT THE STICKER WILL HELP BUT IT IS ONLY A START WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WITH THE POSITION WE ARE IN TODAY WITH MANUFACTURERS SAID MR OUDENDIJK THERE MAY WELL BE A NUMBER OF DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THE EUROPEAN BROADCAST UNION EBU IS TESTING DIFFERENT FLAVOURS OF HD FORMATS TO PREPARE FOR EVEN BETTER HDTV FURTHER DOWN THE LINE IT IS SIMILARLY CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION ON HDTV FORMATS AS WELL AS WHICH DEVICES WILL SUPPORT THE FORMATS WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS BUYING EXPENSIVE DISPLAYS NEED TO ENSURE THEIR INVESTMENT IS WORTHWHILE SAID PHIL LAVEN TECHNICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE EBU THE TV DISPLAY MANUFACTURERS WANT US TO WATCH HD ON SCREENS THAT ARE AT LEAST 42IN 106CM TO GET THE TRUE IMPACT OF HD THEY SAY ALTHOUGH SMALLER DISPLAYS SUFFICE WHAT MAY CONVINCE PEOPLE TO SPEND MONEY ON HDREADY DEVICES IS THE FALLING PRICES WHICH CONTINUE TO TUMBLE ACROSS EUROPE THE PRICES ARE DROPPING AN AVERAGE OF 20 EVERY YEAR ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS LCD PRICES DROPPED BY 43 IN EUROPE AS A WHOLE LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO MR OUDENDIJK \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Documents_tokenized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
